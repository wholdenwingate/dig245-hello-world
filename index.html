    <h1>Name, Class, Major:</h1>
    <p>William Holden-Wingate, 2025, Economics Major</p>

    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>I read the course description and was interested in making websites.</p>

    <h2>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h2>
    <p>I took CSC121 last semester and don't have any other experience.</p>

    <h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>
    <p>I want to be able to code a functioning website to a high level</p>

    <h2>Select a tutorial from learn-computing. Follow the instructions and summarize it 100-150 words.</h2>
    <p>I did the tutorial on Networks. It began with explaining what IP adresses are and what DNS is. I then was able to learn what my IP adress is and how to find other public IP adresses. I then learned about different basic Network Commands such as ping, whois, and traceroute. It was useful to go through five of the commands one by one and learn about what each command does and its purpose. I definetly will need to spend more time learning more about what specific parts of the returned code mean.  </p>

    <h2>Select 3 web-based projects that represent your interests, aspirations, and passions. See the CWD examples for inspiration. List each project with its title, a link to it, and 2 to 3 sentences describing it and why it is remarkable.</h2>
    <p>How Bad is your Spotify? https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/ This site uses AI to look through your music and judges it. It is very cool and interesting to ling my music account and have it analyze my songs I listen to. It is really cool to see the AI compare it against "objectivly bad music"</p>
    <p>Moral MAchine. https://www.moralmachine.net/ This site is for humans to judge moral decisions made by AI. It is really interesting to see what decisions you versus others made and even getting a breakdown of your choices..</p>
    <p>Where in the USA is this? https://pudding.cool/games/where/ This website shows photos of places in the USA and makes you place a pin on the map where you think the photo was taken. I love grography and so it is very cool to be able to play around with the program</p>

    <!-- This assignment was overall fairly difficult for me because it was my first time doing any type of coding like this. Although the more I spent on this the easier it got. -->
